# Collision — game.exe 1.14d

`.\COLLISN\Collisn.cpp`, 0x64c000..0x64f800.

## The grid (FUN_0064c900)

Each room owns a u16 per subtile (5x5 per tile), header `{x, y, w, h,
…}` then the cells (`FUN_00619730` gives the rect; allocated at
Collisn.cpp line 0x185). Building it, for every floor, wall and roof tile
of the room (`FUN_00619660/6a0/6e0`), `FUN_0064c790`:

- ORs the tile's 25 DT1 subtile flag bytes in (`FUN_0064c4c0`): subtile
  row r, column c of the tile takes flag **(4 − r)·5 + c** — the DT1
  stores subtile rows bottom-up;
- adds bits from the tile entry's own flags (+0x14 of a 0x30 record):
  0x02 → 0x10, 0x40 → 0x01, 0x80 → 0x04, over the whole tile
  (`FUN_0064c700`): FUN_0066db20's tile flags, each word sharing the
  tile ORs its own in.

The grid lives at room1 +0x20 (`{x, y, w, h}` in subtiles, then the room's
tile rect; u16 cells from +0x24, row-major). It's made with the room1
(`FUN_00619890`), right after the room's tiles (`FUN_0061b190`): the tiles
of the near rooms already up count, each clipped to this room's rect
(`FUN_00619df0`). A room coming up later that re-picks a shared tile
(`FUN_0066e740`) patches the grid of the room it lies in, if that's up
(`FUN_0064c860`: the old tile's flags off, the new one's on). So a grid
depends on the order the rooms came up in, as the tiles do.

Bits: 0x01 blocks walking, 0x08 blocks the player; walking units test
mask 0x1c09 (walls 0x09 plus door 0x400, monster 0x800, player 0x1000 —
units stamp their own footprints). Outside every room reads 0x27.
An object's footprint bits (`FUN_006209d0`): 0x400, | 0x04 with
BlockMissile; 0x8000 for a SubClass 4 non-door; a door 0x806 with
BlocksVis, else 0x808 with BlockMissile, else 0x400. An item 0x200, a
warp tile 1.

## Rects and units

- `FUN_0064d0d0` makes a unit's rect from its position and size:
  `x − size/2 … x − size/2 + size − 1` (same for y), inclusive.
- `FUN_0064cc30` tests a rect against a mask, `FUN_0064cd70` sets bits,
  `FUN_0064cce0` clears them; `FUN_0064ceb0` splits a rect across rooms.
- Point tests by collision pattern (`FUN_0064d870`): 0 one subtile
  (`FUN_0064d450`); 1/3/5 a plus — the subtile and its four neighbours
  (`FUN_0064d100`, edges clipped per room); 2/4 bigger (`FUN_0064d4a0`).
  Players and small units use the plus.
- `FUN_0064e7b0` → `FUN_0064dea0`: nearest free spot (spawns, the town
  start).

## d2d

- `Level::walk` is built like the room grids (flipped rows), one grid
  for the whole DS1, from the picks as each cell's room had them when it
  came up (`Level::Pick::stamp`, `Level::patches`); objects and standing
  NPCs stamp 0x01 over their size rect.
- Order: a level is built in list order; as the player brings rooms up
  (`player_moved`, the arrived room then the near list's), `relevel` lays
  the whole level again in that order (the rest after, list order). The
  oracle: `diff_drlg.py 1-10 <level> collision` brings game.exe's rooms up
  shuffled ($ORDER) and compares every room's grid (levels 2–39, 10/10).
- `Scene::unit_blocked` is the plus test with mask 0x09.
- Pathing: game.exe's path types (below). The player walks type 7
  (`rules::player_path` / `ai.cpp player_walk`); monsters, town NPCs,
  Cain, the merc and pets walk as monsters, 0xd then 0xf
  (`rules::monster_path`; `ai.cpp path_to`, `set_off` / `walk_on`).

## Path types (`.\PATH\Path.cpp`)

A unit's path (+0x2c, 0x200 bytes, FUN_00649d00) has a type (+0x3c, set by
FUN_00648cf0 with flags from `0x6eb690`). FUN_00649970 computes it with the
pather `0x6eb6d8[type]`: 0 / 16 `0x67ad00`, 1 `0x67b850` (search), 2 / 5 /
6 / 0xd `0x679c80` (toward), 3 `0x679e50`, 7 `0x679ed0`, 8 `0x67a000`, 9
`0x679f70`, 0xb `0x679fd0`, 0xc `0x679e60`, 0xf `0x67c2d0`; 4, 0xa and 0xe
(flag 0x40000) go through FUN_00649760 instead.

- A player's path is type 7 (FUN_00649d00 for unit type 0: steps +0x91 =
  0x49, +0x92 = 0x46, mask +0x50 = 0x1c09); FUN_00648dc0 puts it back to 7
  before each walk (FUN_0057f090, from C→S 0x01 / 0x03 → FUN_005809d0 →
  FUN_0057f1f0).
- Type 7 (FUN_00679ed0): the toward pather; taken when its last point is
  within `near` of the end and isn't the start. Else, when the end is under
  18 subtiles off (dx² + dy² < 0x145), the search pather; if that finds
  nothing, the toward path again. So a far click stops at what's in the
  way; a close one goes round it.
- The search (FUN_0067b850): A* in a 200-node pool (FUN_0067b1c0), open and
  closed lists hashed by position (DAT_006f1998 / DAT_006f1b98, 128
  buckets), the open list sorted by cost with ties newest first
  (FUN_0067aed0). Step 2 straight, 3 diagonal; estimate 2 × the long axis +
  the short (FUN_0067adc0). Neighbours (-1,-1) (-1,+1) (+1,-1) (+1,+1)
  (-1,0) (0,-1) (+1,0) (0,+1) (FUN_0067b440). A cheaper way to an open node
  changes its cost in place (not re-sorted); to a closed one it passes down
  the node's up to 8 children (FUN_0067afe0). It keeps the node nearest
  the end (at a tie, one more than 5 further along) and stops at the end, an
  empty open list or a full pool. FUN_0067b690 turns the way into points:
  that node and every turn, start first, the start left out, at most 77.
  Walking to a unit, nothing when all eight subtiles 2 off it are blocked
  (FUN_0067b740).
- A monster's walk (town NPCs too: FUN_005ded90 → FUN_005a7c20 →
  FUN_005a63f0, move mode 0x65 → type 0xd, steps +0x91 = 5): FUN_005a6290
  computes type 0xd (the toward pather, monster-ai.md) and, with no point,
  type 0xf. FUN_005a7c20 gives it a budget of 0x14 points (+0x94); a path
  run out short of its end paths again while that lasts, the points walked
  coming off it (FUN_006503f0 → FUN_00650350).
- The wall pather (FUN_0067c2d0, type 0xf): a line (FUN_0067b9f0,
  Bresenham on the long axis) of at most `steps` − 1 subtiles (`steps` is
  +0x91, 0x28 at least with a unit to walk to), else none; none with two
  subtiles or fewer either. Walking it, a blocked subtile starts two
  tracers from the one before (FUN_0067bdf0), taking turns: one keeps the
  wall on its right (after a step it turns left, blocked it turns right:
  tables 0x6f1f00 / 0x6f1ec0), the other on its left (0x6f1e80 /
  0x6f1e40); they start 45° either side of the line (DAT_006f1e18 + 1 /
  + 7; directions DAT_006f1d98, 0 north, clockwise). A step tries its way
  and up to three turns (FUN_0067bbf0). A tracer back on the line further
  on is spliced in (FUN_0067bd80; the subtile after it isn't tested). One
  stepping onto the other's last-but-one spot ends the path before the
  block; one reaching the other's spot goes on alone until they part.
  Stuck, or past `steps` less the line less the walked, they stop: then
  (unless over 0x50 were left: the path ends at the block) the tracer
  nearer the end ends the path, if nearer than the start. FUN_0067c1e0
  makes the points: each turn and the last (a first step off both axes
  isn't a turn).
- Checked: `tools/emu/moves.py` runs FUN_0067b850, FUN_00679ed0 and
  FUN_0067c2d0 on random walls against the port (6,000 and 9,000 cases,
  all equal).
- ponytail: d2d drops a repeated point (the toward pather's cut-short
  subtile); game.exe spends a frame on it. A target that moves re-paths at
  0.3 cells (the player) or 1 cell (merc, pets: a fresh budget), not
  FUN_006503f0's 5 subtiles off SP2. Town NPCs walking up to the player go
  to a spot, not a unit. The merc's moves carry their own type, pace and
  steps (merc-ai.md).
- Not yet: the tile-entry flag bits, units blocking each other (0x800 /
  0x1000), doors.
