# Which units the cursor takes — game.exe 1.14d

The client's unit under the cursor (`FUN_00467a10`, kept at 0x7a6a94 /
0x7a6a98) is picked each frame by `FUN_00467ac0`. It walks the units of
the rooms round the player and keeps those the hit test
`FUN_00466870` (asserts `.\UNIT\CUnit.cpp`) passes, by type priority
(0x711f98).

## The hit test

`FUN_00466870(ECX unit, EDX x, y, ...)`, with the player as 0x7a6a70:

1. Not in the half of the screen a side panel covers; not a unit with
   +0xc4 bit 21 set.
2. **May the player interact with it** (`FUN_00465c60`, ECX player, EDX
   unit), or a skill-cursor exception (`FUN_00464ec0`, `FUN_00464f70`).
   Otherwise no.
3. Selectable: +0xc4 bit 1, or a unit the left or right skill's target
   kind takes (`FUN_00464310` → the callbacks at 0x711f34, which take
   dead monsters, mode 0xc); and +0xc8 bit 7.
4. The pixel or box test (per-layer selectable rectangles when the class
   asks for them, else the frame's box).

## May the player interact with it (`FUN_00465c60`)

- **In town** (`FUN_0061ab00` → `FUN_006426a0`: levels 1, 40, 75, 103,
  109): yes, apart from player-on-player cases.
- **Elsewhere**, each side is first traded for its owner: a monster in
  the client's owner list (`FUN_00479150`, 0x7bb5bc) or with +0xc8 bit 10
  (owner id at +0x98) counts as that player. Then:
  - the same unit or the same owner: no (the player's own pets);
  - two players: the hostility flag (`FUN_004dc440(8)`);
  - the player and a monster: MonStats2 `alSel` (flags +4 bit 4,
    `FUN_004638a0`) yes; `noSel` (bit 5) no; else yes unless they are
    friends (`FUN_00650d70`).

Friends (`FUN_00650d70`) are two units of the same alignment, evil (0)
or good (2). A unit's alignment is stat 172 under state 105
(`FUN_006259b0`; set by `FUN_005543b0`). A player's is 2 (net-packets.md
0xaa capture). So outside
town a monster turned good, a converted one (alignment 2, `FUN_005d0350`),
isn't under the cursor. The column names come from the MonStats2
field table in `FUN_006571a0` (`alSel` 0x6ecf94 bit 4, `noSel` 0x6ecf8c
bit 5).

In 1.14d's MonStats2, `alSel` is set on cain1, tyrael1, navi,
boneprison1..4, darkwanderer, act2guard4, act2guard5, izualghost,
malachai, tyrael3, drehyaiced and ancientstatue1..3; `noSel` on 29
critters and helpers (chicken, rat, cow, act2hire, invisopet, the
catapult spotters, the injured barbarians, ...).

## d2d

`Monster::ally_not_interact` (components/game/ai.hpp) drops a monster of
alignment 2 without MonStats interact. For a converted monster outside
town that reads as game.exe's answer; it is traced from the code, not
compared against an oracle. It differs where game.exe's rule is other
than alignment: in town `FUN_00465c60` refuses nothing for alignment;
outside town it passes an `alSel` monster and refuses a `noSel` one
before the alignment test (the hit test's selectable and pixel checks
still follow); and outside town it refuses a good unit with MonStats
interact unless it is `alSel`, where d2d keeps it.

Not traced here: the click's own path. d2d's pick (a held attack drops
the unit, the click walks) follows its hover.
